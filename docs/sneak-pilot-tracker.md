## 3. Detailed Participant Records & Logs

### PILOT #1: IDX Embed Only (Existing Member Website)
* **Goal:** Prove SNEAK IDX container & embed script operate cleanly inside a third-party host (WordPress Elementor/Beaver Builder) with full-market IDX consumer search and participant-scoped lead capture & featured listings.
* **Participant Details:**
  * MLS Participant / REALTOR: Ursula Weinkauff
  * MLS Agent ID / Participant Identity: `633942`
  * Brokerage: Local Real Estate LLC
  * Controlled Pilot Operator: Kevin Weinkauff
  * Controlled Pilot Email / Login: `kmwcollegeapps@gmail.com`
  * Pilot Type: Internal Controlled IDX Embed Validation
  * Existing Member Website URL: `https://coconutcoastrealtors.org`
  * Authorized Embed Origin: `https://coconutcoastrealtors.org`
  * Target Test Page: `https://coconutcoastrealtors.org/idx-test/`
  * Account ID: `acc_1787583729221_cv3ma`
  * Site ID: `site_1787583729221_rzxfa`
  * Site Key: `ursula-weinkauff-pilot`
  * Display Scope: `market` (Full-market MLS consumer search)
  * Featured Scope: `agent` (`633942` — Ursula Weinkauff)
  * Plan: `standard`
* **Operator Authorization Note:**
  * "Operator explicitly approved use of Ursula Weinkauff's verified agent scope 633942 for PILOT-01 while Kevin Weinkauff operates the controlled pilot using kmwcollegeapps@gmail.com."
* **Phase 7.1 Full-Market Model Correction:**
  * *Context:* SNEAK originally restricted ordinary consumer search queries to the participant's `ListAgentMlsId`. In Phase 7.1, tenant display scope was decoupled from participant identity: ordinary consumer search, map, open houses, and listing details now query full MLS market inventory (`37,145` active listings across SWFL), while `agent_mls_id = 633942` powers featured listings (`/idx/v1/agent/633942/listings`) and lead routing.
  * *Internet Display Rules:* Applied migration `0022_sneak_idx_display_controls.sql` enforcing Bridge OData `InternetEntireListingDisplayYN` (suppress non-IDX listings) and `InternetAddressDisplayYN` (mask address as "Address Undisclosed" when 0).
* **Operational Milestones:**
  * Account & Site Provisioned Date: 2026-08-24 20:33 UTC
  * Invitation Gate Satisfied Date: 2026-08-24 16:03 UTC (Pre-verified real Mailjet auth normalized)
  * Embed Snippet Installed on Page: 2026-08-25 12:58 UTC
  * Phase 7.0 Initial Verification Date: 2026-08-25 13:00 UTC
  * Phase 7.1 Full-Market Model Deployment & Live Verification: 2026-08-25 14:45 UTC (100% PASS)

  * Phase 7.3A Search Parity & Responsive Filter Overhaul: 2026-08-25 18:35 UTC (API PASS / Browser Verification Pending Operator Visual Check)
* **Phase 7.3A Search Parity & Live Fixes:**
  * *Responsive Property Category Navigation:* Completely overhauled `#propertyTypePills` with smooth horizontal touch-scrolling (`overflow-x: auto; -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; scrollbar-width: none`), guaranteeing all 4 categories (`For Sale`, `Rental`, `Commercial`, `Lot & Land`) remain 100% visible and interactive across desktop, tablet, and mobile embed viewports.
  * *UI Build Telemetry & Cache Busting:* Injected deterministic build tag `CCOR_IDX_UI_BUILD = '2026.08.25.7.3a'`, `data-ui-build="2026.08.25.7.3a"` on body, and `&v=2026.08.25.7.3a` cache-buster in `embed.js`.
  * *More Filters Drawer:* Implemented sliding drawer containing 20+ consumer-facing filters grouped into Property Subtype, Size & Year Built, Location (City Chips, County, ZIP, Subdivision), Wave-1 Amenities (Waterfront, Private Pool, Garage Spaces, New Construction), and Listing Activity (Open House, New in 7 Days, Price Reduced).
  * *Context-Aware Category State Isolation:* Commercial and Land searches dynamically suppress beds, baths, and residential subtypes from primary bar and drawer.
  * *Card Presentation:* Commercial cards display building sqft, lot size, subtype, year built. Land cards display lot size acres, subdivision, city, county. Fake `0 bd 0 ba 0 sqft` placeholders suppressed.
  * *Wave-1 Advanced Search Database Migration:* Applied migration `0024_sneak_advanced_filters.sql` (`WaterfrontYN`, `PoolPrivateYN`, `GarageSpaces`, `NewConstructionYN`, `Zoning`, with indexes on `SubdivisionName`, `PostalCode`, `LivingArea`, `LotSizeAcres`, `YearBuilt`).
* **Live Validation Evidence:**
  * Live Public URL: `https://coconutcoastrealtors.org/idx-test/` (HTTP 200 OK)
  * Live Static UI Build: PASS — `data-ui-build="2026.08.25.7.3a"`, `CCOR_IDX_UI_BUILD = '2026.08.25.7.3a'`
  * Live Commercial API: PASS — 515 active commercial listings
  * Live Land API: PASS — 8,680 active land listings
  * Live More Filters API: PASS — Living area, lot acres, year built, subdivision, price reduced, open houses, sort options (`sqftDesc`, `acresDesc`, `yearDesc`) verified
