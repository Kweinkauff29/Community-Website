## 3. Detailed Participant Records & Logs

### PILOT #1: IDX Embed Only (Existing Member Website)
* **Goal:** Prove SNEAK IDX container & embed script operate cleanly inside a third-party host (WordPress Elementor/Beaver Builder) with full-market IDX consumer search and participant-scoped lead capture & featured listings.

  * MLS Participant / REALTOR: Ursula Weinkauff
  * MLS Agent ID / Participant Identity: `633942`

  * Display Scope: `market` (Full-market MLS consumer search)

* **Operator Authorization Note:**
  * "Operator explicitly approved use of Ursula Weinkauff's verified agent scope 633942 for PILOT-01 while Kevin Weinkauff operates the controlled pilot using kmwcollegeapps@gmail.com."
* **Phase 7.1 Full-Market Model Correction:**
  * *Context:* SNEAK originally restricted ordinary consumer search queries to the participant's `ListAgentMlsId`. In Phase 7.1, tenant display scope was decoupled from participant identity: ordinary consumer search, map, open houses, and listing details now query full MLS market inventory (`37,145` active listings across SWFL), while `agent_mls_id = 633942` powers featured listings (`/idx/v1/agent/633942/listings`) and lead routing.
  * *Internet Display Rules:* Applied migration `0022_sneak_idx_display_controls.sql` enforcing Bridge OData `InternetEntireListingDisplayYN` (suppress non-IDX listings) and `InternetAddressDisplayYN` (mask address as "Address Undisclosed" when 0).
